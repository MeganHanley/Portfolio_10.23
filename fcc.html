            <h1>Federal Communications Commission Responsive Redesign</h1>
        </div>




        <div class="myContributions">

            <h2>2. My Contributions</h2>
            <p>Throughout this project, I conducted navigation & homepage heuristic evaluations on the Federal Communications Commission website, as well as usability tests to uncover flawed interface designs & user pain points. Following these steps, I used a prioritization matrix to highlight the features that were most important to both the user, and the FCC.</p>

            <div class="imageContainer">

                <img src="images/8pages.png" class="img-fluid" id="image-1" alt="8 Annotated Pages">

                <img src="images/14interviews.png" class="img-fluid" id="image-2" alt="14 User Tests & Interviews">

            </div>

            <p>After synthesizing the data from my tests & interviews, I redesigned the FCC sitemap using my card sorting results & created a low-fidelity prototype design for both desktop & mobile platforms. </p>

            <p>I conducted six usability tests & facilitated four sessions of the “5-Second Test” on my low-fidelity prototype redesign. After iteration into a mid-fidelity prototype, I designed a user interface style tile and applied the stylization to the FCC homepage & navigation, resulting in a working high-fidelity prototype.</p>

        </div>




        <div class="discovery">

            <h2>3. The Discovery Process</h2>
            <p>My team and I began by examining the current desktop design of the webpages on the FCC site. Our heuristic evaluation examined the existing site’s homepage & navigational interface for design flaws. We uncovered several issues with the current design, but the main saboteurs were: the over-reliance on text & inclusion of redundant information throughout the page.</p>

            <div class="imageContainer">

                <img src="images/discovery.png" class="img-fluid" id="image-3" alt="Heuristic Webpage Analysis">

            </div>

            <p>Other significant design flaws which required my team’s attention were inconsistent navigational elements, unconventional link outputs, overuse of jargon, & unintuitive section headings. These insufficiencies in the FCC’s webpage designs negatively impact a users ability to successfully navigate the site.</p>

            <p>Upon conducting a color accessibility test, my team discovered that the shades of blue used in some segments of text did not meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.</p>

            <div class="imageContainer">

                <img src="images/discovery2.png" class="img-fluid" id="image-4" alt="Color Accessibility Analysis">
            </div>

            <p>Proper color & accessibility design on a government webpage should be heavily prioritized by the FCC to ensure that all users have the ability to navigate their site, & mitigate the risk of facing a lawsuit.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="research">

            <h2>4. User Research & Findings</h2>
            <p>In this research project, my team and I planned & remotely conducted 4 user interviews & 6 user tests with current & potential FCC website users in the United States. Our discoveries were similar to the findings from our heuristic evaluations. Users found the text to be overwhelming, which hindered their ability to scan the site’s content for specific information, and the site’s navigation was unclear, leaving some of our users unable to complete specific tasks set out for them.</p>

            <p>Below is the prioritization matrix created to synthesize our user test results:</p>

            </div>

        </div>



        <div class="ideation">

            <h2>5. Ideation Design</h2>
            <p>To begin the ideation process, I took a complete inventory of the primary and secondary navigation titles on the site. I then separated each title into its own respective card to prepare for user card sorting. </p>

            <div class="imageContainer">

                <img src="images/ideation.png" class="img-fluid" id="image-6" alt="">
            </div>

            <p>Four potential users took part in an un-moderated, remote card sorting session for our research. I synthesized the card sorting results to create a re-designed, user-focused sitemap for the new and improved navigation of the FCC website design.</p>

        </div>


        <div class="lofiTest">

            <h2>6. Low-Fidelity User Testing & Findings</h2>
            <p>Using the new sitemap produced from my card sorting results, I created mobile & desktop low-fidelity prototypes for the FCC homepage and navigation. With these prototypes, I conducted four sessions of the “5-Second Test”, with potential users. This tests gives participants only 5 seconds to view a design before being asked to share their thoughts.</p>

            <div class="imageContainer">

            </div>

            <p>The “5-Second Test” results provided valuable insight into the layout and spacing of the low-fidelity prototypes. Using this feedback, i iterated my design to meet potential user’s expectations.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="hiFi">

            <h2>7. High-Fidelity Interactive Prototype</h2>
            <p>Once I had made the final iterations to the mid-fidelity wireframes, I drafted a style tile for the new and improved FCC website re-design. This style tile included guidelines on typography, button interfaces, color palettes, iconography, and high-resolution image samples.</p>

            <p>Applying the style tile guidelines to the mobile and desktop prototypes produced a streamlined, intuitive design with user friendly iconography and easily digestible content.</p>
